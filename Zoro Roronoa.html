            <h3>Role in the Story</h3>
            <p><strong>Position:</strong> Combatant and Swordsman of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is widely recognized as the "Vice-Captain" in all but name due to his seniority, authority, and the crew's trust in him.</p>

                    <p>He often serves as the straight man to the crew's more eccentric personalities, especially Luffy's. He is typically calm, collected, and perceptive in a crisis.</p>

                    <div class="sword-name">Wado Ichimonji</div>
                    <p>A priceless sword that was once Kuina's. It represents his promise and is his most treasured possession.</p>

                    <p>The sword that once belonged to Kozuki Oden. It is the only blade to have ever injured Kaido. It is incredibly difficult to wield, as it forcibly draws out large amounts of the user's Haki, but mastering it has drastically increased Zoro's power.</p>
