            <p>Eren Yeager is the main protagonist and arguably the central antagonist of the monumental manga and anime series "Attack on Titan" (Shingeki no Kyojin), created by Hajime Isayama.</p>
            <p>He is one of the most complex, controversial, and deeply analyzed characters in modern fiction. His journey is not one of a traditional hero, but a tragic and brutal descent that challenges the very concepts of morality, freedom, and the nature of evil.</p>

                    <p><strong>Driven by Rage and a Desire for Freedom:</strong> From the beginning, Eren is defined by an intense, almost innate fury against anyone who would take away freedom. He saw the walls as cages and longed for the unexplored outside world he read about in books.</p>
                    <p><strong>Simplistic Worldview:</strong> His morality was black and white: humanity (inside the walls) = good, Titans = evil.</p>
