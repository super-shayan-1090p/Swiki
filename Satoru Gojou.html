            <h2>Character Overview</h2>
            <p>Satoru Gojō is a central and immensely popular character from the hit manga and anime series Jujutsu Kaisen, created by Gege Akutami.</p>
            <p>He is not just any character; he is widely considered the "Strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer" in the modern era of the series, and his presence is a major driving force of the plot.</p>
            
            <h3>Role in the Story</h3>
            <p><strong>Position:</strong> A Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer and a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High.</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> He is the primary mentor to the main protagonist, Yuji Itadori, as well as to Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Gojō is a complex and charismatic character defined by his contradictions:</p>
            
            <h3>Confident and Arrogant</h3>
            <p>He is fully aware of his own power and isn't shy about it. He often displays a playful, almost childish arrogance, teasing his opponents and colleagues alike.</p>
            
            <h3>Unconventional and Playful</h3>
            <p>He defies the conservative higher-ups of the Jujutsu world and has a very casual, sometimes insufferable, demeanor. He loves sweets and often wears a playful smirk or a blindfold.</p>
            
            <h3>Deeply Convicted and Caring</h3>
            <p>Beneath the flippant exterior, he is a revolutionary at heart. His core goal is to reform the corrupt and outdated Jujutsu society by nurturing a new, stronger generation of sorcerers who share his ideals. He genuinely cares for his students and their growth.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Through education and nurturing the next generation, I will create allies who are strong, smart, and capable. That's how we'll change the Jujutsu world from the ground up."

        </div>
        
        <div class="section full-width">
            <h2>Abilities and Power - "The Strongest"</h2>
            <p>His title is not an exaggeration. His power set is considered one of the most formidable in all of anime/manga.</p>
            
            <ul class="ability-list">
                <li>
                    <div class="ability-name">The Six Eyes (六眼, Rikugan)</div>
                    <p>An innate technique that gives him immense perception and analytical prowess. It allows him to see Cursed Energy in microscopic detail, reduces the cost of his own Cursed Energy to almost zero, and grants him incredible precision.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <div class="ability-name">Limitless (無下限, Mugenka)</div>
                    <p>His inherited technique, which allows him to manipulate space at an atomic level through the concept of Infinity. Its main applications are:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Infinity (無下限術式, Mugenka Jutsushiki)</h3>
                    <p>His automatic and constant defense. It brings the concept of "convergence" from Zeno's Paradox (Achilles and the Tortoise) into reality, forcing anything that approaches him to slow down infinitely and never actually reach him.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue (術式順転・「蒼」, Jutsushiki Junten: "Ao")</h3>
                    <p>He creates a void of "negative space" that pulls in and crushes everything in its vicinity with immense attractive force.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cursed Technique Reversal: Red (術式反転・「赫」, Jutsushiki Hanten: "Aka")</h3>
                    <p>Using "Reverse Cursed Technique" to power his ability, he creates a phenomenon of "imaginary mass" that repels everything with tremendous explosive force.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hollow Technique: Purple (虚式「茈」, Kyoshiki "Murasaki")</h3>
                    <p>His ultimate attack, which combines Blue and Red to create an imaginary mass that erases anything in its path from existence.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <div class="ability-name">Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void (無量空処, Muryōkūsho)</div>
                    <p>His Domain forces an infinite amount of information into the target's brain, overloading their senses and leaving them completely paralyzed and conscious but unable to move or think.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why He's So Iconic</h2>
            
            <h3>Power Fantasy</h3>
            <p>He embodies the "untouchable, overwhelmingly powerful" archetype done to perfection.</p>
            
            <h3>Charismatic Design</h3>
            <p>His signature blindfold (which he wears to prevent sensory overload from his Six Eyes), his spiky white hair, and his tall, lean figure make him visually striking.</p>
            
            <h3>Complex Motivation</h3>
            <p>He's not just strong for the sake of it; his strength is tied to his loneliness and his grand goal of changing the world for the better.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section spoiler-warning">
            <h3>⚠️ Major Plot Spoiler (Anime-Only Viewers Beware) ⚠️</h3>
            <div class="spoiler-content">
                <p>In the manga's Shibuya Incident Arc, Gojō is successfully sealed away by his enemies in a special prison object called the "Prison Realm." This event is a catastrophic turning point in the story, as the removal of the "strongest" sorcerer plunges the Jujutsu world into chaos and forces the younger generation to step up. His absence remains a central and highly debated plot point.</p>

        <p>In short, Satoru Gojō is the pinnacle of power in Jujutsu Kaisen, a charismatic and complex mentor figure whose presence (or lack thereof) defines the fate of the entire world within the series.</p>
