        <div class="section">
            <h2>Personality and Character Arc</h2>
            <p>Killua's character is defined by his journey from a emotionally suppressed assassin to a loyal friend seeking his own identity.</p>

                <div class="personality-item">
                    <div class="personality-title">Initially Cold and Cynical</div>
                    <p>Having been raised as an assassin, he was initially detached, pragmatic, and saw killing as a normal solution. He was trained to feel no emotion or remorse.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="personality-item">
                    <div class="personality-title">Playful and Mischievous</div>
                    <p>Once he breaks free from his family's control, his true, more childish and playful personality emerges. He has a sweet tooth (especially for chocolate) and often teases his friends lightheartedly.</p>

                    <p>His core character arc revolves around his relationship with Gon. Gon's unwavering friendship and trust teach Killua what it means to have a bond that isn't transactional. Killua's loyalty to Gon becomes absolute, and he is fiercely protective of him.</p>

                    <p>Despite his immense power, he often struggles with feelings of inadequacy and self-worth, especially when comparing himself to Gon's natural talent and determination. A major part of his journey is learning to value himself for who he is, not just as a weapon.</p>
